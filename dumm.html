    <h1>This is just some text</h1>
    <p>Loss of customers to competition is a problem for telecom companies because it is expensive to acquire a new customer and companies also are striving to retain their existing customers .Businesses are vigilant on measuring churn because keeping an existing customer is far less expensive than acquiring a new one. Customer retention can be achieved by offering quality services and products. In addition to this a company should try to understand the nature of their customers as this will be the most effective way to curb customer attrition.</p>
